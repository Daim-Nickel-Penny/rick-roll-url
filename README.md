<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


Who in the world is not tired of getting **rickrolled** now and then on the internet.
The worst part is that you can't take rickroll them back because it gets super predictable. 




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Simply copy the link, https://top-shows.netlify.app/ and share it with anyone you want. 
The best part is that it shows a different embeded image and the video is of "rick roll" :-)

*P.S. It works the best in discord*
